"""Placing an order and finding out what happened to it.

Four steps, and the interesting parts are the failures rather than the happy
path:

  1. place the order
  2. get its id back out of the response
  3. poll until it reaches a terminal state
  4. cancel it if it never does

The documentation covers each call. What it cannot show is that step 2 has four
outcomes wanting four different responses: Schwab rejected it and nothing was
placed; Schwab accepted it and gave back no id, so something is probably live
and untracked; the response belongs to another account, so an order is live
there; or you got an id.
