"""A complete streaming consumer, with backpressure.

The README shows the four lines that start a stream. This shows the shape a
long-running one wants: a queue between the socket and your processing, so a
slow consumer drops old data rather than stalling the reader, and an error
handler so a feed that quietly stops looks different from a quiet market.

Run it with a token file you already have --- see the getting started guide for
how to create one.
