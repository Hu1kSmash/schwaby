    An absent ``signScale`` is **not** one of these --- it is scale 0, which
    is how ``AskSize`` and ``BidSize`` arrive: one quote carries an ``Ask``
    of ``{"lo": "13720000", "signScale": 12}`` beside an ``AskSize`` of
    ``{"lo": "19200"}``.

    The scale is what turns the mantissa into a number, so guessing one is a

    six decimal places, is only the value that happens to be common.

    A real .NET ``Decimal`` scale is 0 to 28, so ``signScale`` does not exceed

    million the value underflows to a zero that compares equal to zero, and a

    '''Decodes the scaled-integer decimal objects Schwab streams on
    ``ACCT_ACTIVITY``.

    Those fields do not arrive as numbers. They arrive as a serialized .NET
    ``System.Decimal``::

        {"lo": "6860000", "signScale": 12}       ->  Decimal('6.860000')

    a 96-bit integer mantissa, which arrives whole in ``lo`` as a string of
    digits, and a ``signScale`` packing the scale in its magnitude and the
    sign in its parity. The conversion is undocumented publicly; Schwab's
    Trader API support confirmed it in writing, and it reproduces every
    payload anyone here has captured, including Schwab's own worked example
    ``{"lo": "40000000", "signScale": 13}`` -> ``Decimal('-40.000000')``.

    Five things this gets right that a first attempt usually does not, each of
    which costs a value, usually as a wrong number rather than an error:

    * **The mantissa can be wider than 32 bits.** ``lo`` carries all of it, and
      a fill principal above ``4294.967295`` at ``signScale`` 12 needs more.
      A decoder that treats ``lo`` as one 32-bit member of .NET's three
      refuses the largest amounts on the feed, or wraps them.
    * **An odd** ``signScale`` **means negative.** The sign is not the side:
      direction is ``BuySellCode``, and this branch exists so a genuinely
      negative field, such as principal on a buy, does not decode positive.
    * **A mantissa-less object is zero, not unknown.** ``LeavesQuantity``
      arrives that way on the final fill of a completed order, and reading it
      as unknown reports a complete fill as still outstanding.
    * **An absent** ``signScale`` **is scale 0, not a missing scale.** The
      serializer omits whatever is zero, and that applies to the scale as
      much as to a mantissa member: ``AskSize`` and ``BidSize`` arrive as
      ``{"lo": "19200"}`` beside an ``Ask`` of
      ``{"lo": "13720000", "signScale": 12}`` on the same quote. Refusing
      the shape --- which this function did until it was checked against a
      capture --- costs both sizes on every quote it appears in.
    * **A** ``Decimal`` **is returned, never a float.** These are money;
      :meth:`OrderBuilder.set_price
      <schwaby.orders.generic.OrderBuilder.set_price>` refuses floats for the
      reason :ref:`price_strings` gives, so a decoded value can be fed
      straight back into a reprice.

    :param value: A decimal object, or a number or string. A non-object is
                  validated and returned as a :class:`~decimal.Decimal`. That
                  path is defensive rather than observed: every money and
                  quantity field in the one capture on hand is an object, on
                  every message. What *is* measured is the empty string,
                  which arrives as the ``SUBSCRIBED`` ack's ``MESSAGE_DATA``
                  and reaches here from any consumer decoding fields
                  generically.
    :raises UnusableDecimalScale: if a lone ``lo`` is not an unsigned
                                  integer below ``2 ** 96``, if any member
                                  of a ``mid`` or ``hi`` layout is not an

                                  least one of the four names. If Schwab ever
                                  renames all of them at once that message
                                  will read as a caller's mistake, and only
                                  the exception will say so --- there is no
                                  once-per-key line for that case.

                                  An empty object is neither: it
                                  is the omit-everything spelling of zero,
                                  and decodes as one. Each of these is
                                  refused rather than computed with, because
                                  each produces a plausible wrong number
                                  rather than an error.

                                  **Any** unrecognised key refuses the
                                  object. Not decoded around: an
                                  unrecognised key may be a renamed one, and
                                  from inside a payload the two are
                                  indistinguishable --- the serializer omits
                                  what is zero, so a component that is
                                  missing because it was renamed looks
                                  exactly like one that is missing because
                                  it is zero.

                                  The cost is deliberate. A key Schwab adds
                                  arrives on every decimal object at once, so
                                  every money and quantity field raises until
                                  ``schwaby`` knows the key --- a loud,
                                  same-day failure, catchable per field, and
                                  the key is named in the log on the first
                                  message. The alternative on this feed is a
                                  silent wrong price.

                                  A mapping whose ``items()`` cannot be read
                                  is refused, and so is one carrying the
                                  same key twice once its names are reduced
                                  to plain text.
    :raises UnusableDecimalScale: if a non-object value is not a number, or
                                  carries an exponent past 64 in either
                                  direction. The empty string reaches this
                                  function from the ``SUBSCRIBED`` ack.

    Every failure is a :class:`~schwaby.utils.SchwabError` and a
    :class:`ValueError`, so a caller wrapping each field in one ``except``
    keeps the rest of the message. That is the point of the bound above: a
    hang is not catchable, so it must not be reachable.
