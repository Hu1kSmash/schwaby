def _assert_finite(name, price, *, price_field=False):
    '''Rejects order fields which are not a finite number.

    ``price_field`` says which kind of field is being guarded, because the two
    take different types and only the caller knows which this is. A price field
    is a string or a ``decimal.Decimal`` in Schwab's schema; a numeric one --
    quantity, the offsets, the activation price -- is a number, and takes an
    ``int`` or a ``float`` and nothing else. Passing a string to a numeric
    field used to build it straight into the order, so
    ``set_price_offset('abc')`` produced ``{"priceOffset": "abc"}``; it now
    raises, and so does every prebuilt template given a string quantity.

    NaN and the infinities do not name a price, a size or an offset, and they
    arrive by computation rather than by typing: a limit derived from a quote
    that was missing, a trailing stop offset divided by a size that turned out
    to be zero. Without this they serialize happily and leave as part of a real
    order --

        {"orderType": "LIMIT", "price": "NaN", "quantity": NaN, ...}

    -- which is the wrong place to discover the problem. Note the bare ``NaN``:
    ``json.dumps`` emits that by default and it is not valid JSON, so such an
    order is not merely wrong, it is untransmittable without a parser willing
    to accept a non-standard token.

    This has to run *before* the positivity checks rather than alongside them,
    because NaN compares False against everything: ``quantity <= 0`` and
    ``activation_price <= 0.0`` are both False for NaN, so those guards do not
    fire and the value passes straight through them.

    On a price field, strings are otherwise passed through untouched, as they
    always have been; only the spellings Python reads as non-finite are
    refused, because
    ``str()`` of a computed value is the obvious way to reach here.

    Depth is deliberately not policed. ``Decimal(0.1)`` carries a float's

    both price fields ``number($double)``, so it parses to the same double a

    float-derived values span 0 to 53 decimal places and string arithmetic
