        '''Whether ``error`` means no amount of retrying will get a new token.

        Two ways that happens. The stored token may be unusable before anything
        is sent -- authlib raises MissingTokenError or InvalidTokenError
        locally, and those are handled first below. (UnsupportedTokenTypeError
        is terminal only when authlib will not replace the stored token by
        itself, which only the client can see, so ``_translate_token_errors``
        decides that one.) Otherwise Schwab may have rejected the grant, which
        is the rest of this.

        RFC 6749 section 5.2 defines ``invalid_grant`` as the token endpoint's
        answer when the grant presented -- here, the refresh token -- is
        invalid, expired or revoked. It is the one failure on this path which
        retrying cannot fix, because a new refresh token only comes from the
        full authorization_code flow.

        Schwab does not put that code where the standard says it goes. It
        answers with an outer error of ``unsupported_token_type``, which RFC
        7009 defines for the *revocation* endpoint and which describes nothing
        that happened here, and nests the real response as a JSON string inside
        the description::

            unsupported_token_type: 400 Bad Request: {"error_description":
            "Refresh token is invalid, expired or revoked","error":"invalid_grant"}

        Observed on a live account by letting a refresh token
        reach its seven day expiry deliberately. Schwab does not document this
        response, so both spellings are accepted: the standard placement, in
        case it is ever corrected, and the nested one it actually uses.

        Anything unrecognized returns False. A failure wrongly called terminal
        stops an application which only needed to retry, which is worse than
        one wrongly called transient.
        '''

    def _translate_token_errors(self):
        '''Presents a failed token refresh as a schwaby exception.

        authlib raises OAuthError when Schwab rejects a refresh. That happens
        in the middle of an ordinary request, because the session refreshes the
        token on the way past, so an application which never touches the token
        directly still has to catch it -- and to catch it, has to import
        authlib and know a type this library does not document anywhere.

        Only OAuthError is translated. It never comes from a data request: one
        which fails does not raise at all, since httpx2 reports status through
        the response. Network errors are left as the httpx2 exceptions they are,
        because a connection failure while refreshing and one while fetching a
        quote are the same problem and are not distinguishable from here.

        Not every OAuthError comes from Schwab, though. MissingTokenError and
        InvalidTokenError are subclasses of it which authlib raises locally,
        before any HTTP call, when the stored token has no refresh token or is
        otherwise unusable. Nothing about those improves with time, so they are
        reported as needing a new login rather than as something to retry.

        UnsupportedTokenTypeError is raised locally too, when the stored token
        has no access token of a type authlib can send. It is terminal unless
        authlib will replace that token by itself, which takes an expiry it
        acts on -- one it reads as an int, near enough to be reached -- and a
        refresh token to refresh with. Without both, every call fails the same
        way and nothing is ever sent. With both, the token is refreshed as the
        expiry nears, so it stays retryable. It is told apart by class, not by
        its ``unsupported_token_type`` code, which Schwab uses for its own
        rejections -- one of those has been seen to recover.

        ``unusable_token_response`` does not come from Schwab either. This
        library raises it when the token endpoint answers with something that
        is not a usable token, so that it is refused before authlib stores it,
        and it is reported as retryable: nothing was stored, and the next call
        refreshes again.

        ``get_price_history``, and ``get_orders_for_account`` goes through

        The count starts at 0 because ``warnings.warn`` is called one frame up,
        by ``_warn_if_naive``, and interprets ``stacklevel`` relative to

        .. warning::

          **Schwab ignores** ``sort_order`` **and** ``frequency`` **on this
          endpoint.** Both are sent --- they appear in the request URL --- and
          the response is identical whichever values you pass: always the top
          ten by *share* volume, always for the whole session.
          ``PERCENT_CHANGE_DOWN`` does not invert the ranking, and rows come
          back monotonically descending in ``volume`` while
          ``netPercentChange`` is unordered. Measured against a live account
          by polling eleven indices every five minutes for a whole session:
          two different ``sort`` values returned identical lists in all 495
          index-cycles.

          The streaming screener does honour both. If you need a ranking other
          than volume, or a time-resolved bucket, use
          :meth:`~schwaby.streaming.StreamClient.screener_equity_subs`; a
          subscription at frequency ``0`` reproduces this endpoint's output.
          See :ref:`screener`.

        Two fields in the response are easy to misread, and Schwab's own
        documentation does not describe them accurately:

        * ``totalVolume`` is the **index** total, not the instrument's. It is
          identical on every row of a response --- in all 990 responses of the
          session above, without exception. Summing it across rows sums the
          same number ten times.
        * ``marketShare`` is derived, not measured: ``volume / totalVolume *
          100`` exactly. Because it is relative to the index queried, the same
          instrument reports a different ``marketShare`` under ``OPTION_ALL``
          than under ``OPTION_PUT`` while its ``volume`` is unchanged.

        ``volume`` is the instrument's own share volume, and ``trades`` its
        own trade count.

        Two things about the values themselves, from the same session:

        * **The membership barely moves.** Across four hours of five-minute
          polls, the median change between consecutive polls was zero names
          and the maximum was one, with only twelve or thirteen distinct
          symbols appearing all session. That follows from ranking on
          cumulative session volume, which only grows. Polling this endpoint
          frequently gets you the same list.
        * ``INDEX_ALL`` **does not return indices.** It returns equities, it
          is not the same set as ``EQUITY_ALL``, and none of its members
          appeared in the ``NYSE`` list at any point while eight or nine of
          ten appeared in ``NASDAQ``. What it actually selects is not
          documented and has not been established here.

        :param index: Category of mover. See :class:`Movers.Index` for valid

        :param sort_order: Requested ranking. See :class:`Movers.SortOrder`
