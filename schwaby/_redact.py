'''Keeps secrets out of every log this library writes, at every level.

Always on. There is no mode to enable and no flag to forget: every logger this
library owns carries :class:`RedactingFilter`, first among its filters, and
``websockets`` is handed :class:`FrameRedactingAdapter` over whichever logger
it uses. A secret is
registered the moment it enters the library -- the app key and secret when a
client or flow is made, each token as it is loaded, exchanged for or
refreshed, the authorization code and the URL carrying it, each account number
a response or frame names -- and from then on any log line, exception text or
stack carrying it has the value replaced however the record is rendered.

Registration cannot be the only defence, because it only covers what was
registered. :func:`mask` replaces the values of the keys that carry secrets by
name, before this library formats a payload for a log line, so a token is
masked in the streamer's LOGIN request whether or not it was registered.

Imports nothing from this package, so every module can use it.
