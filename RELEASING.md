# Releasing and maintaining `schwaby`

Notes for whoever works on this next, including future me. `schwaby` is a
standalone project: there is no upstream to track, no pull request queue, and no
compatibility to preserve with anything but its own published releases.

## Rules that have earned their place

**Write a test that fails before the fix.** Every defect found so far sat in code
with 100% line coverage. Coverage measures which lines ran, not whether the
result was right. Before accepting a test, revert the fix and watch it fail — a
test that passes both ways is worse than none, because it looks like protection.

**A negative result about an installed package is not a result until you know
which directory produced it.** `sys.path[0]` is the current directory, so
`import schwaby` run from the repository reads the working tree and ignores what
pip installed. Three consecutive reproductions of a reported install collision
came back "does not reproduce" that way, while inspecting the source tree. `cd`
somewhere else first, and check `schwaby.__file__` before believing the answer.

**And an editable install goes stale on its own.** `.venv` held an editable
`schwaby` 3.0.2 whose finder mapped the name `schwab` to a directory 4.0.0 had
renamed away, so `import schwaby` *and* `import schwab` both raised
`ModuleNotFoundError` from outside the repo while the suite passed --- pytest
runs from the root, where the working tree is on the path regardless. The rule
above sends you out of the repo to get a trustworthy answer and this is what
you find when you get there. `pip install -e .` after anything that moves a
package, and before believing an import failure you did not expect.

**A red-proof that greps for `FAILED` cannot see a `subTest`.** pytest reports
a failing subtest as `SUBFAILED(...)`, so a harness matching `FAILED .*::` calls
it green. One mutation was reported as unnoticed here and was in fact caught,
by a subtest, which is the worst direction for that error: it invites deleting a
guard that works.

**Use `../audit/redproof.py` rather than a shell loop.** It checks pytest's
return code; a grep for `FAILED` misses `SUBFAILED`, and it requires the failure
to carry the message you named. Adding cases for one release's work immediately
caught two claims that were wrong about which message a mutation produced.

**Check the mutation actually applied.** A `sed` expression spanning two lines
matches nothing, and a restore within the same second reuses stale bytecode
(CPython invalidates on mtime and size). Both have produced a false green here.
Clear `__pycache__`, and confirm the file changed before believing the result.

**The suite mocks the network.** It proves the library builds the request it
intended and says nothing about whether Schwab accepts it. Anything asserting
real API behaviour has to be established against a live account, and the
assertion should say so and give the date.

**Never send a price as a binary float.** `set_price` and `set_stop_price` take a
string or a `decimal.Decimal` and refuse a float, because scaling one and
truncating sent a price a tick low.

**When fixing a defect class, grep for the shape rather than the instance.**
`truncate_float` was fixed to truncate in decimal rather than binary. The
identical defect — `int(float(value) * 1000)` — sat untouched in
`OptionSymbol.build()` for another release and mis-encoded 590 of the 100,000
cent-granular strikes between `$0.01` and `$1000.00`, naming a different contract
on the order-placement path. Nobody looked, because the first fix felt complete.
The same shape recurred in 3.0.0: a fix removed one empty package from the wheel
and stopped, while `find_packages()` was also shipping `tests/`.

**Ask what the bug was covering for.** Several times now a correctness fix has
exposed something worse the defect had been masking. Truncating prices hid that a
`Decimal` built from a float renders its 57-character binary expansion. Migrating
to `httpx2` for correct types flipped the exception hierarchy under the
downstream consumer. The question belongs in the fix, not the postmortem.

**An assertion about an empty result needs a positive control.**
`assertEqual([], offenders)` holds when the guard works *and* when the input
never reached it. Prove the collection found something, in the same test.

**A statement is made where it lands, not where you stand.** This has cost twice
now: a diff range measured as `vPREV..HEAD` and asserted about `vPREV..vNEXT`,
and a patch written against the unreleased version and handed to someone running
the released one, where `str(None)` quietly became the string `"None"`. Both
were true where they were written. Before sending or committing a claim, ask
which version, which range, and which machine it will be read on.

**A claim nothing checks will drift, silently.** A README, a changelog preamble
or a docstring asserting something no test covers goes stale without a symptom.
Prefer the weaker sentence you can verify.

**Do not bundle.** A commit that fixes one thing and tidies another cannot be
reverted, bisected to, or described in a changelog entry without dragging the
tidying along.

**Run the suite after merging into `main`, not just on the branch.** Two branches
that each pass can still fail together. It costs four seconds.

## Dependencies

`.github/dependabot.yml` watches the GitHub Actions used by the workflows and
opens a pull request when one goes stale. They had drifted five major versions
behind before anyone noticed, and the only symptom was a deprecation warning
inside a job annotation nobody reads.

**Dependabot offers one action per pull request, and two of these only work
in pairs.** `upload-artifact` and `download-artifact` are versioned separately
and their majors are offset by one from v5 onward, because download took a
breaking change upload did not. The versions that go together are the ones
released on the same day --- upload v7 with download v8. Dependabot opened a
pull request bumping upload to v7 and none for download, which would have left
`publish.yml` handing an artifact between mismatched majors on the one path
that only runs during a release. Merge both or neither, and prove the pair
round-trips a file before believing it.

It deliberately does not watch the Python dependencies. Those are floors rather
than pins, this library places trades, and upgrading one is a decision that wants
the verification below — not a bot's pull request merged on a quiet afternoon.

**There are no optional dependencies and there should not be any.** `dev` is the
only extra. An extra that everybody has to install is a hard dependency with a
way to get it wrong, and `pip freeze` silently drops extras — which is what
turned the 2.3.0 `login` split from a saving into three late failure modes.

## Cutting a release

1. `CHANGELOG.md` — a new section, written for someone deciding whether to
   upgrade.

2. `schwaby/version.py` — bump. **Major if anything public is removed or
   renamed**, minor for added surface or changed behaviour, patch for fixes
   alone.

   Since 2.6.0 this is on PyPI, so `schwaby` or `schwaby>=2.6` in a requirements
   file resolves to whatever is newest and upgrades into a breaking release by
   accident. A changelog banner does not reach someone who never opens one, so
   the version number has to carry it.

3. **Anything naming a version**, which goes stale silently:

   ```shell
   grep -rn 'schwaby@v\|schwaby==' README.md docs/ schwaby/
   grep -rnE '\b[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+' README.md docs/*.rst schwaby/ \
       | grep -vE '127\.0\.0\.1|https?://'
   ```

   The first should be empty. Prose naming a version is worse than a pin,
   because it will not match a pin grep and the release may land under a
   different number than the one written. That is not hypothetical: "Since
   3.0.1 `import schwab` warns" was written into `README.md` and
   `docs/getting-started.rst` while preparing 3.0.2 and survived a review
   round, because this step only looked for pins. It was caught before the
   tag, which is luck rather than process.

   Hence the second grep, and note what it is *not*: an allowlist of lead-ins
   like `Since|As of|New in` catches the sentence that was found and misses
   `3.0.1 added a warning`, `starting with 3.0.1`, `from v3.0.1 onward`. A
   check justified by a class of problem has to match the shape --- any
   version-looking number --- not the phrasings already seen. It will have
   hits: read each one and keep only those describing something that already
   shipped and stays true. Say what changed, not which release changed it.

4. **No dates in shipped documentation.**

   ```shell
   grep -rnE '\b20[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}\b' README.md docs/*.rst schwaby/
   ```

   Should be empty. A finding measured against a live account is worth
   recording as a finding; the date it was measured is not. Documentation
   describes how the API behaves in this version, and a reader hitting
   "measured 2026-09-08" has to decide whether it still holds --- which is a
   question they cannot answer and which the sentence invites. Say what the
   behaviour is, and say it was measured rather than inferred if that matters.

   Dates belong in `CHANGELOG.md`, which is a dated record by construction, and
   in `~/schwab/` working notes, which are not shipped.

5. **For a documentation-only release, prove it rather than asserting it.**

   ```shell
   python - <<'EOF'
   import ast, subprocess, pathlib
   PREV = 'vPREV'
   PKG = 'schwaby/'
   # A pathspec that matches nothing returns an empty list, which reads as
   # "no library file changed" -- so a wrong path passes this check for any
   # release at all. 4.0.0 renamed the package and left this pointing at
   # `schwab/`; assert the path before trusting its silence.
   assert pathlib.Path(PKG).is_dir(), PKG + ' is not the package directory'
   changed = subprocess.run(['git', 'diff', '--name-only', PREV + '..HEAD',
                             '--', PKG],
                            capture_output=True, text=True).stdout.split()
   def strip(src):
       t = ast.parse(src)
       for n in ast.walk(t):
           if isinstance(n, (ast.Module, ast.ClassDef, ast.FunctionDef,
                             ast.AsyncFunctionDef)):
               b = n.body
               if (b and isinstance(b[0], ast.Expr)
                       and isinstance(b[0].value, ast.Constant)
                       and isinstance(b[0].value.value, str)):
                   b.pop(0)
       return ast.dump(t)
   for f in changed:
       old = subprocess.run(['git', 'show', PREV + ':' + f],
                            capture_output=True, text=True).stdout
       new = pathlib.Path(f).read_text()
       print(f, strip(old) == strip(new))
   EOF
   ```

   A text diff cannot answer this. 3.0.3 changed 139 lines across six files,
   including 66 in `client/base.py` and 41 in `streaming.py`, and a careful
   reader looking at that diff would reasonably go hunting for a behaviour
   change that is not there. Comparing the parsed trees with docstrings
   stripped separates prose from behaviour, and leaves `version.py` as the
   only executable difference --- which is the safest shape a bump can have.

   Say which method established it in the release notes, not just the verdict.
   A consumer pinning this against funded accounts should be able to re-run
   the check rather than trust the claim.

6. Verify, on **3.11, 3.12 and 3.14** — 3.14 is what the downstream consumer
   runs, and `asyncio` semantics differ below 3.12 as well as above it:

   ```shell
   pytest tests/ -q
   python -m build
   python -m twine check --strict dist/*
   python -m sphinx -W docs/ /tmp/docs-build
   ```

   **`twine check`'s output must be read, not glanced at.** It once reported a
   failure that was missed in truncated output, which would have published a
   release with no description. Note it is a much weaker gate for a markdown
   README than it was for reStructuredText: measured, it rejects only an empty or
   whitespace-only document. `tests/packaging_test.py::LongDescriptionTest`
   asserts the real property, and `readme_renderer[md]` must be installed or the
   check silently passes having rendered nothing.

   `python -m build` earns its place: `setup.py` is not imported by the suite, so
   an edit leaving it unparseable is invisible to `pytest`.

7. Commit, then `git tag -a vX.Y.Z`. Write the message from a file — backticks in
   `git tag -m` are executed as command substitution, which silently swallowed a
   word from the v2.5.0 tag.

8. `git push origin main && git push origin vX.Y.Z`

9. `gh release create vX.Y.Z -R Hu1kSmash/schwaby --notes-file ...`

   **Creating the release is what publishes to PyPI.**
   `.github/workflows/publish.yml` runs on a published release, re-runs the suite
   on all five Pythons, runs `twine check --strict`, verifies the built version
   matches the tag, and uploads via trusted publishing. Pushing a tag alone
   publishes nothing, so a tag can be moved before the release is created. After
   it, the version is permanent: PyPI refuses a re-upload even after a delete.

10. **If you move a tag, say so — a normal `git fetch` will not follow it.**

   Deleting and re-creating a pushed tag is sometimes right; v3.0.0 was re-cut
   before publishing to fold in a documentation change. But git will not move a
   tag ref a client already holds, and says nothing while declining to. So
   anyone who fetched the old one keeps it silently, and the check most likely
   to care — does this artifact match the tag I audited — is exactly the one
   that gets a confident wrong answer.

   A consumer hit this within the hour and had already written "the published
   wheel does not match its own git tag" into their pin comments as a lost
   property. The fetch that fixes it:

   ```shell
   git fetch origin --prune-tags --force --tags
   ```

   Tell anyone downstream when a tag moves. A stale ref plus a confident tool is
   worse than a wrong answer, because a wrong answer invites a second look.

11. **Re-check any claim about the release against the tag, after tagging.**

   The range available while preparing a release is `vPREV..HEAD`, which excludes
   the commit that bumps `version.py` — so the convenient measurement is
   systematically the one that flatters the claim. "v2.4.1 touches nothing under
   `schwab/`" was measured that way, asserted about `v2.4.0..v2.4.1`, and a
   consumer ran the command and found `schwab/version.py`.

## The distribution name and the import name

Both are `schwaby`, as of 4.0.0. `pip install schwaby` then `import schwaby`,
and there is nothing further to explain to a reader.

They used to differ: the distribution was renamed to `schwaby` at 2.6.0 and the
package stayed `schwab`, so that a consumer moving over changed one line of
`requirements.txt` and nothing else. The cost was that `schwaby` and `schwab-py`
both provided a directory called `schwab`, so whichever pip installed second
silently overwrote the other's files --- no warning, no failure at install time,
and a version banner that named whichever project had won. 3.0.1 shipped an
import-time check for it, which could itself be overwritten by the collision it
detected, and 3.0.2 withdrew that. 4.0.0 renamed the package instead.

So: the two install side by side now, and **the install documentation must not
tell anyone to uninstall `schwab-py` first.** It was correct through 3.0.3 and
is wrong from 4.0.0 --- an instruction to uninstall the package that owns
`schwab/` will strand anyone who still imports it.

`tests/packaging_test.py::…test_the_distribution_and_the_package_have_the_same_name`
holds the names together. If a future release wants them to diverge again, that
test is the thing to argue with first.

A git install works for testing an unreleased commit:

```shell
pip install "schwaby @ git+https://github.com/Hu1kSmash/schwaby@<sha>"
```

Pin a commit, never a branch. Tags before the 2.6.0 rename carry `schwab-py` in
their metadata, so `pip` refuses `schwaby @ git+...@v2.5.1`.

**Never write `pip install schwab-py` as an instruction for this project.** That
installs a different, much older codebase, and it will appear to work because the
importable package has the same name either way.
