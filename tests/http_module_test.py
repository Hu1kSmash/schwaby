'''The HTTP module this library guards against must be the one authlib built
its OAuth2 client on.

authlib 1.8 stopped importing httpx directly. It now imports httpx2 when that
package is installed and falls back to httpx when it is not, so which of the two
this library is actually running against is decided by the environment rather
than by anything here.

That matters because the two are not interchangeable and do not share a
hierarchy. httpx2.Response is not httpx.Response, and httpx2.ConnectError is not
a subclass of httpx.ConnectError. So a mismatch does not fail loudly -- an
isinstance guard simply stops matching and an except clause simply stops
catching. Both do so only in production, where the response comes from authlib's
session; a test which builds its own httpx.Response never notices, which is why
the rest of the suite passes either way.

These tests deliberately ask which module object was imported rather than what
it was bound as, so they say the same thing before and after a rename and fail
only on a genuine mismatch.
