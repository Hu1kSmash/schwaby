'''The red-proof entries tools/redproof.py judges: one per guard, each naming
the mutation that turns the guard off, the test that must then fail, and a
substring that must appear in the failure.

Add an entry when you fix something. The comment above an entry is the
record of why the guard exists, and of what made an earlier version of the
entry lie; keep it when the entry changes.
