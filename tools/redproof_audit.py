'''Runs pytest for tools/redproof.py, recording what the run wrote.

    python -I -B tools/redproof_audit.py <pytest arguments>
    python -I -B tools/redproof_audit.py --where
    python -I -B tools/redproof_audit.py --collect <out.json> <pytest arguments>

Run from the root of a copy of the repository: the copy's directory goes first
on ``sys.path``, as ``python -m pytest`` would put it, so the tests import the
copy's ``schwaby``. ``--where`` prints the file ``import schwaby`` resolves to,
which is how the harness proves that before it judges anything. Without that a
mutated copy and an import from somewhere else look the same: every verdict a
false GREEN.

With ``REDPROOF_AUDIT`` set, an audit hook goes in before pytest is imported
and records what the run writes: an ``open()`` or ``os.open()`` for writing,
a rename, a removal, a permission or time change, a truncation. Each is
recorded by its path, and what changes a file's bytes or attributes also by
the file it touched (its device and inode), so a write through a symbolic or
hard link to a tracked file, or through a descriptor, names that file as
surely as a write by its own name. A rename or a removal acts on one name
only, and is known by that name: removing a hard link a test made to a
tracked file changes nothing about the file. Making a link or a directory
is not recorded: neither can be a tracked file, which is removed, and
recorded, before anything else can stand at its path. ``os.open`` is
wrapped, since its audit event carries no ``dir_fd``; the wrapper records
the file it opened and the event inside it records nothing. The record is
written to that path when pytest returns. The harness compares the copy
with the snapshot after the run, which catches a tracked file left changed;
this catches one changed and put back. A write the hook could not place is
recorded as unresolved, and the harness fails the run for it, as it does for
a run that left no record. Recording never raises into the run: an exception
there would fail the call being audited, and a test failing for that reason
is a red the mutation did not cause. What it cannot see: a write by a
process the test started; a permission or time change made through a
symbolic link to a tracked file (its event does not say whether it followed
the link); and an ``os.open`` a caller took before the hook was put in,
which is recorded at the wrong path.

``--collect`` writes ``{node id: xdist group}`` for every collected test with
an ``xdist_group`` mark. The harness reads it to keep two entries that share a
fixed port (the login flow's callback server, on 6969) from running at once.
